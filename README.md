# Using React Router
## Dentist page
We used the following features of react router:
1. Wrapping components in a `<Route>` tag
1. Using `<Link>`s
1. Passing props to a routed component
1. Referencing the url params

## Your portfolio page
Make a portfolio page for yourself that uses all these tools. It can have any sections, content, and styling that you want. If you want to eventually use this page as your real portfolio to show employers, that's great! If not, that is ok, you will just make this app as a chance to practice these router tools.

Create a new react app, in a dir of your choice, to be the portfolio. It will not be a graded deliverable.
